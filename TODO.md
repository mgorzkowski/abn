#### TODO:
##### Engennering issues:
    1) Tests adding (CUnit with C or unittest with Python),
    2) Static code analysing,
    3) Decumentation generating (Sphinx or something like that),
    4) Reverse engennering doing to check time and memmory occupancy. Generate raport if it will be satisfying, otherwise look at Feature issues (2),
    5) Release 0.1 version past all issues done,

##### Feature issues:
    1) Add div and mod operations,
    2) Add assembly support for few architectures (x86, x64, ARM, maybe more) for few functions (for those what time or memory occupation aren't satisfying for me.) (?),
    3)
